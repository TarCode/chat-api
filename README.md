# Chat App Server

Add your emails to `MY_EMAILS` in `src/index.js` 

## Run in Development

```
npm install
```

then
```
npm run dev
```
And make sure you have the [Chat App Client](https://github.com/TarCode/chat-client) so you can get redirected after clicking on the link you receive once the server is running
